# ðŸ§¬ RNAseq Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates a complete **RNA-Seq analysis workflow** using Bioconductor packages.  

Weâ€™ll walk through:  

- âœ… Quality control of RNA-Seq data  
- âœ… Normalization and preprocessing  
- âœ… Differential expression analysis with **DESeq2**  
- âœ… Pathway enrichment to interpret biological meaning  
- âœ… Co-expression network analysis with **WGCNA**

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objective
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:  
- Identify **differentially expressed genes (DEGs)**  
- Interpret the **biological processes** regulated by these genes

## ðŸ§ª Experimental Design

- **Treatment**: Dexamethasone (1 Î¼M, 18 hours) â†’ potent synthetic glucocorticoid  
- **Control**: Untreated cells  
- **Goal**: Identify genes responsive to glucocorticoid treatment  

Glucocorticoids are widely used to treat **asthma and inflammatory airway diseases**.  
Understanding their molecular effects on airway smooth muscle cells provides insights into therapeutic mechanisms.
