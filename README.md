# RNA-seq Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates a complete RNA-seq analysis workflow using Bioconductor packages.  

The workflow covers:  
- Quality control of RNA-seq data  
- Normalization and preprocessing  
- Differential expression analysis with **DESeq2**  
- Pathway enrichment to interpret biological meaning  
- Co-expression network analysis with **WGCNA**

## Learning Objective

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:  
- Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs)  
- Interpret the biological processes regulated by these genes

## Experimental Design

- **Treatment**: Dexamethasone (1 Î¼M, 18 hours)  
- **Control**: Untreated cells  
- **Goal**: Identify genes responsive to glucocorticoid treatment  

Glucocorticoids are widely used to treat asthma and other inflammatory airway diseases.  
This study characterizes their molecular effects on airway smooth muscle cells, providing insight into therapeutic mechanisms.
